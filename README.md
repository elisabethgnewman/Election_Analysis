# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

In this module, we were tasked with assisting a Colorado congressional committee with auditing the election results using Python rather than Excel. In this module, we determined the:
1. Total Vote Count,
2. List of Candidates,
3. Total Number of Votes per Candidate,
4. Percentage of Votes per Candidate, and
5. Winner of the Election.

## Resources
The resources that were used to perform this audit were Python and a csv file (election_results.csv).

## Summary
After performing the analysis, I came up with the following results:
There were 369,711 votes in the election for the three candidates.
Charles Stockham received 85,213 (23.0%),
Diana DeGette received 272,892 (73.8%), and
Raymon Doan received 11,606 (3.1%).
Based on the above, I determined that Diana won the election.

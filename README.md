# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

In this module, we were tasked with assisting a Colorado congressional committee with auditing the election results using Python rather than Excel. In this module, we determined the:
1. Total Vote Count,
2. List of Candidates,
3. Total Number of Votes per Candidate,
4. Percentage of Votes per Candidate, and
5. Winner of the Election.

## Resources
The resources that were used to perform this audit were Python and a csv file (election_results.csv).

## Summary
After performing the analysis, I came up with the following results:
There were 369,711 votes in the election for the three candidates.
Charles Stockham received 85,213 (23.0%),
Diana DeGette received 272,892 (73.8%), and
Raymon Doan received 11,606 (3.1%).
Based on the above, I determined that Diana won the election.

## Challenge Overview
In the Module 4 challenge, we were tasked with pulling the election results for the counties. In this election, there were three counties: Denver, Araphoe, and Jefferson. Similarly to how we pulled the candidate results, this challenge involved pulling the county turnout results.

## Challenge Summary
This challenge looked at voter turnout by county. The total count of votes remained at 369,711. Jefferson county representd 38,855 (10.5%) of the votes, Denver represented 306,055 (82.8%) of the votes, and Arapahoe represented 24,801 (6.7%) of the votes. Denver had the largest voter turnout.

One way that I would potentially change this script in the future would be to add in the total population count of the counties. While it may seem that more people from Denver showed up to vote, it is more likely than not that Denver just has the highest population of the counties that were audited. It could also be interesting to see what percentage of the total turnout by county voted for each candidate.
